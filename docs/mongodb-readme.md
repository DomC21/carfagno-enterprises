# MongoDB Atlas Integration for Waitlist System

This document provides an overview of the MongoDB Atlas integration for the Carfagno Enterprises waitlist system.

## Current Status

The MongoDB Atlas integration is currently in progress. We have implemented a robust fallback mechanism that allows the application to function even without a MongoDB connection.

## Features

1. **MongoDB Atlas Integration**
   - Connection to MongoDB Atlas cluster
   - Mongoose models for waitlist entries
   - API routes for waitlist submission and retrieval

2. **Fallback Mechanism**
   - In-memory storage when MongoDB is not available
   - Seamless transition between storage mechanisms
   - Indication of storage mechanism in API responses

3. **API Routes**
   - `/api/waitlist`: Submit a new waitlist entry
   - `/api/waitlist-entries`: View all waitlist entries
   - `/api/db-status`: Check database connection and stats

## Documentation

2. [Connection String Format](./mongodb-connection-string.md)
3. [Waitlist Database Schema](./waitlist-database-schema.md)
4. [Troubleshooting Guide](./mongodb-troubleshooting.md)
5. [Fallback Mechanism](./mongodb-fallback-mechanism.md)
6. [Connection Issues](./mongodb-connection-issues.md)

## Next Steps

1. Resolve MongoDB Atlas connection issues
2. Create a new database user with a simpler password
3. Verify network access settings
4. Test the connection with the new credentials
5. Update the environment variables in Vercel

## Testing

To test the MongoDB connection:

```bash
node scripts/test-mongodb-comprehensive.js
```

To test the API routes with the fallback mechanism:

```bash
npm run dev
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Test User","email":"test@example.com"}' http://localhost:3000/api/waitlist
curl http://localhost:3000/api/waitlist-entries
curl http://localhost:3000/api/db-status
```

## Deployment

The application is designed to work even without MongoDB configuration, making it suitable for deployment to Vercel without immediate database setup.

To configure MongoDB in Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Navigate to the "Environment Variables" section
3. Add the following variables:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: The full connection string with credentials
   - `MONGODB_DB`: Set to "waitlist"
4. Make sure to add these variables to all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
