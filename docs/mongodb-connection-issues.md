# MongoDB Atlas Connection Issues

This document provides a detailed analysis of the connection issues encountered with MongoDB Atlas and the recommended solutions.

## Current Status

We are experiencing authentication issues when trying to connect to the MongoDB Atlas cluster. Despite multiple connection approaches, we consistently receive the error:

```
Authentication failed.
```

## Attempted Solutions

We have tried the following approaches:

1. **Standard connection string**:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://domcarfagno:BullishonNvda1@cluster0.psz9e.mongodb.net/waitlist?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
   ```

2. **URL-encoded password**:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://domcarfagno:${encodeURIComponent('BullishonNvda1')}@cluster0.psz9e.mongodb.net/waitlist?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
   ```

3. **Admin database**:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://domcarfagno:BullishonNvda1@cluster0.psz9e.mongodb.net/admin?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
   ```

4. **No database specified**:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://domcarfagno:BullishonNvda1@cluster0.psz9e.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
   ```

5. **Different drivers**:
   - Native MongoDB driver
   - Mongoose

## Possible Causes

1. **Cluster Provisioning**: The MongoDB Atlas cluster might still be in the process of provisioning. This can take 5-10 minutes after creation.

2. **User Authentication**: The database user "domcarfagno" might not be properly configured or the password might be incorrect.

3. **Network Access**: The IP whitelist might not be configured to allow connections from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).

4. **Password Complexity**: The password "BullishonNvda1" contains mixed case and numbers, which might cause issues if not properly URL-encoded.

5. **Free Tier Limitations**: The MongoDB Atlas free tier might have connection limitations or restrictions.

## Recommended Solutions

1. **Wait for Provisioning**: Wait 5-10 minutes for the cluster to fully provision.

2. **Create a New Database User**:
   - Navigate to "Database Access" in MongoDB Atlas
   - Create a new user with a simpler password (e.g., "password123")
   - Ensure the user has "readWrite" access to the "waitlist" database

3. **Verify Network Access**:
   - Navigate to "Network Access" in MongoDB Atlas
   - Add "0.0.0.0/0" to allow connections from anywhere
   - Ensure there are no pending changes that need to be applied

4. **Use Fallback Mechanism**: Continue using the fallback in-memory storage mechanism until the MongoDB connection issues are resolved.

## Fallback Implementation

Our application is designed to work even without MongoDB connection:

1. If MongoDB is not available, it will fall back to in-memory storage
2. This ensures the application remains functional during development or if there are database connection issues
3. The API responses include an indication of which storage mechanism was used

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring the MongoDB Atlas dashboard for any status changes
2. Try creating a new database user with a simpler password
3. Verify network access settings
4. Consider reaching out to MongoDB Atlas support if issues persist
